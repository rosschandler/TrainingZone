  <h1> Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Mini Site 2 - Training Zone</h1>
  <p>&lt;Ross Chandler &amp; jc245302 &gt; </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The aim of this website is to increase the number of Training Zones customers and thus revenue. It aims to do this by promoting its company and services offered, increasing the brands recognition in the local mature age job seekers demographic in an effort to boost sales. <br>
  
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> 
The success of this website will be evaluated on the number of new customers attracted in the three month period beginning at the websites launch. The number of new customers in this period will be compared with a three month period prior to website launch.

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience of this site is predominantly local mature age job seekers (28-50). This population was chosen as this demographic forms the current majority of customers. To cater for this audience, which may be slightly more computer illiterate than the average young audience, the site will be simple and easy to navigate. As this audience may be more used to using a phone to contact a company, contact details and a phone number will be made obvious.
